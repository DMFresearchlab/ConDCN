# ConCN v1.0
This is the first version of the condcision project (confirmation bias project)
It includes a function to measure the participant threshold using a staircase, a functional localizer (it should be reviewed to check whether it is compatible with this new experiment) and the main experiment.
__Main experiment logic__
Participants will be presented with 3 similar grating sequences per trial. Their task is to judge whether the mean gratings orientation is closer to the diagonal or the cardinal axis. They have 3 opportunities to respond correctly. At the end of each triplet trial, participants will receive feedback about their performance.
Participants are supposed to earn a small ammount of money for each correct response (max 3 euros).
There is a staircase constantily updating the difficulty as a function of the response in the first trial sequence of each triplet.
The response mapping change randomly in each trial sequence presentation to minimize response biases that could explain the decision biases.
